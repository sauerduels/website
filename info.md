## Format

All events will use a traditional double elimination format. This means that the participants will be seeded in a bracket based on ELO, and play through the bracket until they are eliminated. All matches with the exception of the finals will be a best of 1. The finals will be a best of 3. You can look at some example tournament brackets [here](http://sauerduels.challonge.com/).

## Maps

For map selection, five maps will be randomly selected from the pool, then each player will veto two maps, and the map remaining will be played. The weaker seeded player will always veto first. For the finals, each player will pick one map, and if necessary, the player who went undefeated in the bracket will get the final pick.

## Servers

We will be using multiple servers hosted in Europe or North America for all of our events. Here is the connect command:

`/connect sauerduels.me 10000|20000|30000|40000`

## Issues

If you or your opponent is lagging you may pause the game and wait for the lag to subside, or if the lag persists, talk to a staff member. If for any reason the server goes down or a player loses their scores, a staff member will decide whether to replay or end the match. All decisions made by a member of our staff are final.

## Cheating

There will not be an anti-cheat client that is required to play. However, we do have a server side anti-cheat detection feature which can still detect certain methods of cheating. Players with a cheating history will not be allowed to play.
