## Sign Up

You can sign up by creating a Challonge account and using our [sign up page](/sign-up/) or by sending us a request on Discord/IRC. Events will last around 3 hours, but there will be time to take breaks in between your matches. It is okay to sign up and cancel later, but please DO NOT play one or two games and quit.

## Format

All events will be played using the round robin format. This means that players will be put into groups, and play one game against each opponent in their group. Then, after all the games are completed, the top two players from each group will advance to the semi-finals facing the opposite player from each group. If there are more than 2 groups, only the top player will advance. To reward the top finishing player, they will only need one victory to advance to the finals, while their opponent will need two. The finals will be a best of 3 series regardless of who advances. The losers will play in a standard single match for 3rd place. If there are not enough players for more than one group, the top 3 players will advance to the next round. You can look at some example tournament brackets [here](http://sauerduels.challonge.com/).

## Tiebreakers

We will use a set of tiebreaking rules if there are ties within a group. This will determine seeding and who advances to the finals. All rules will be used in order until one of the tiebreakers determines a winner. The rules are as follows:

  * Better win/loss record vs other tied participants
  * Best of 1 tiebreaking matches, with ties for 3 or more participants, players will be seeded by higher score ratio versus tied participants

## Servers

We will be using multiple servers hosted in Europe and/or the USA for all of our events. Here is the connect command:

`/connect sauerduels.me 10000|20000|30000|40000`

## Crashes

If for any reason the server crashes or a player loses their scores, an admin will decide whether to replay or end the match, depending on the circumstances.

## Maps

We want the map picking to be as fair and equal as possible. Round robin matchups will be only one game, so 3 maps will be randomly selected from the pool for each game. Then, the players each get to veto one of these maps, and the map that was not vetoed will be played. The player with the lower ELO ranking MUST veto first. For the semi-final the player with the worse record will get the first pick, and the higher seed will pick second if necessary. For title matches, the player with the better record will have the option to pick first or defer, as well as the final veto if vetoing out the rest of the pool is necessary due to a 1-1 tie. Here are the current map pools:

| Efficiency | FFA | Instagib |
| :--------: | :-: | :------: |
| aard3c | corruption | academy |
| academy | hades | complex |
| frozen | metl2 | duel7 |
| legazzo | metl3 | douze |
| memento | metl4 | kffa |
| ot | nmp8 | ot |
| turbine | tumwalk | turbine |

## Cheating

There will not be an anti-cheat client that is required to play. However, we do have a server side anti-cheat detection feature which can still detect certain methods of cheating. Players with a cheating history will not be allowed to play. All decisions made by the admin team are final.

## Lag

If you find that either you or your opponent is lagging you may pause the game and wait for the lag to subside, or if the lag persists, talk to an admin. All decisions made by the admin team are final.

## Reminder

Please remember that this is a FREE service provided by volunteers. That means we are NOT being paid and are choosing to do this in our free time. We will do our best to provide high quality service for all players, but we are not perfect, and cannot always satisfy the needs of everyone. Most importantly, don't forget that this is still just a game, so HAVE FUN!
