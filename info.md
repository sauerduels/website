## Sign Up

You can sign up by creating a Challonge account and using our [sign up page](/sign-up/) or by sending us a request on Discord/IRC. Events will last around 3 hours, but there will be time to take breaks in between your matches. It is okay to sign up and cancel later, but please DO NOT play one or two games and quit.

## Format

All events will be played using the round robin format. This means that players will be put into groups, and play one game against each opponent in their group. Then, after all the games are completed, the top player from each group will play against each other in a best of 3 series to determine who wins the title. If there are not enough players for more than one group, the top 2 players will play each other for the title. You can view an example challonge bracket here.

## Servers

We will be using multiple servers hosted in Europe for all of our events. We will have a backup server in case of issues with our primary servers. Here is the connect command:

`/connect game.sauerduels.me 10000|20000|30000|40000`

## Maps

We want the map picking to be as fair and equal as possible. Round robin matchups will be only one game, so 3 maps will be randomly selected from the pool for each game. Then, the players each get to veto one of these maps, and the map that was not vetoed will be played. The player with the lower ELO ranking MUST veto first. For the title matches, the player with the higher ELO ranking will get the first, and final pick if necessary. Here are the current map pools:

| Efficiency | FFA | Instagib |
| :--------: | :-: | :------: |
| aard3c | corruption | academy |
| academy | hades | complex |
| frozen | metl2 | duel7 |
| legazzo | metl3 | duel8 |
| memento | metl4 | douze |
| ot | nmp8 | kffa |
| simplicity | skrdm1 | ot |
| turbine | tumwalk | turbine |

## Cheating

There will not be an anti-cheat client that is required to play. However, we do have a server side anti-cheat detection feature which can still detect certain methods of cheating. Players with a cheating history will not be allowed to play. All decisions made by the admin team are final.

## Lag

If you find that either you or your opponent is lagging you may pause the game and wait for the lag to subside, or if the lag persists, talk to an admin. All decisions made by the admin team are final.

## Reminder

Please remember that this is a FREE service provided by volunteers. That means we are NOT being paid and are choosing to do this in our free time. We will do our best to provide high quality service for all players, but we are not perfect, and cannot always satisfy the needs of everyone. Most importantly, don't forget that this is still just a game, so HAVE FUN!
