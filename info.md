## Sign Up

You can sign up by creating a Challonge account and using our [sign up page](/sign-up/) or by sending us a message on Discord. Events will last about 1-2 hours per mode.

## Format

All events will use a traditional double elimination format. This means that the participants will be seeded in a bracket based on ELO, and play through the bracket until they are eliminated. All matches with the exception of the finals will be a best of 1. The finals will be a best of 3. You can look at some example tournament brackets [here](http://sauerduels.challonge.com/).

## Maps

For map selection, three maps will be randomly selected from the pool, then each player will veto out a map, and the map remaining will be played. The weaker seeded player will always veto first. For the finals, each player will pick one map, and if necessary, the player who went undefeated in the bracket will get the final pick.

## Servers

We will be using multiple servers hosted in Europe and/or the USA for all of our events. Here is the connect command:

`/connect sauerduels.me 10000|20000|30000|40000`

## Crashes

If for any reason the server crashes or a player loses their scores, an admin will decide whether to replay or end the match, depending on the circumstances.

## Cheating

There will not be an anti-cheat client that is required to play. However, we do have a server side anti-cheat detection feature which can still detect certain methods of cheating. Players with a cheating history will not be allowed to play. All decisions made by the admin team are final.

## Lag

If you find that either you or your opponent is lagging you may pause the game and wait for the lag to subside, or if the lag persists, talk to an admin. All decisions made by the admin team are final.

## Reminder

Please remember that this is a FREE service provided by volunteers. That means we are NOT being paid and are choosing to do this in our free time. We will do our best to provide high quality service for all players, but we are not perfect, and cannot always satisfy the needs of everyone. Most importantly, don't forget that this is still just a game, so HAVE FUN!
