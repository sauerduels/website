## About The Project

Sauerduels.me is a service provided by Frosty and Origin. The goal of this project is to provide regularly scheduled tournaments for the remaining players who still enjoy playing Sauerbraten. We keep track of all demos and screenshots, and provide an ELO & stats system for players to track their skill. Our mission is to make our events as smooth and enjoyable as we can, giving the community something to look forward to on weekends. We hope to see you there!
